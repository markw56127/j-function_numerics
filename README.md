# j-function_numerics

This code is used in an attempt to replicated the numerics in Kaneko's paper "Observations on the 'values' of the elliptic modular function j(Ï„) at real quadratics" to be used in my mathematical research purposes.

Additionally, it includes two different regularization processes from Anderson and Bruinier, Funke, and Imamoglu (BFI).
